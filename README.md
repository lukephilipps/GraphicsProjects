# GraphicsProjects
My ongoing Unity graphics projects, each containing Unity Packages and Editor Scripts.

These are designed for the built-in render pipeline and will not work in URP or HDRP. Most are designed to be easily integrated into games via scripts, but keep in mind the scripts act individually and thus attaching multiple without combining their passes will invoke more draw calls.
