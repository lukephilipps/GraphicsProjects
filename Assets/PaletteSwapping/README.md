# Palette Swapper

A project supporting:
* Image downscaling (pixelization)
* Color quantizing
* Palette swapping based on pixel luminance
made for the Unity built in pipeline.

## Usage
Import the .unitypackage file into your scene and simply attach the script to your camera to use the features. The PaletteSwapperEditor.cs file *must* stay in the Editor folder or Unity will not display the easily editable parameters.
